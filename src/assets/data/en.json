The main difference between a framework and library can be described using the term <strong>inversion of control</strong>. When using library, developers are in charge of the flow of the application and they choose when and where to call the library. When using a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for the developers to plug in their code (such as lifecycle hooks in Angular). The framework calls the code that the developer plugs in as needed. Frameworks are usually more complex and provide comprehensive solution tools. In simple terms, library is like a tool whereas a framework is like a toolbox.",
